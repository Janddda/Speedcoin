Intro
-----
Speedcoin is a free open source peer-to-peer secure digital currency that is
completely decentralized (like BitTorrent), without the need for a central 
server or trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and 
transact directly with each other. 

Speedcoin Wallet - It's rather like an online bank account, but even simpler 
to use. A Speedcoin Wallet Address is a unique identifier which allows you to 
receive Speedcoins. With PayPal you send funds to an email address, and similarly 
with Speedcoin you send funds to a Speedcoin address.

Speedcoin-Qt is the original Speedcoin client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Speedcoin transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from 5 minutes to 2 hours
