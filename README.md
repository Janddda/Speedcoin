What is Speedcoin?
----------------

Speedcoin [SPD] is a lite version of Bitcoin using scrypt-adaptive-N as a proof-of-work algorithm.
 - 1 minute block targets
 - subsidy halves in 2 million blocks (~4 years)
 - 10,105 million total coins
 - 10,000 million premined coins
 - 105,000,000 coins ready to mine
 - 25 coins per block
 - Every block to retarget difficulty with Kimotos Gravity Well algorithm

The main problem with any cryptocurrency is that it does not spread widely amongst Internet users 
because new crypto coins are mined by not many people (usually a few hundreds only) who well 
understand computers technology and have special equipment so that ordinary Internet users 
cannot mine new coins and must to buy it.

The main idea behind Speedcoin is different. It is to evenly distribute pre-mined Speedcoins 
to millions of Facebook users across the world through an open clear process on our website. 
Its  process distribution is similar to Iceland's Auroracoin but ours is distributed globally.  

Any Facebook user simply needs to go to Speedcoin.co and log in to our website and enter 
Speedcoin address. 100 SPD will be sent to him automatically. To ensure the same user does 
not use multiple Facebook accounts we request that the user have verified Facebook and 
10+ people in his Facebook friend list.
