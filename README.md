What is Speedcoin?
----------------

Speedcoin [SPD] is a lite version of Bitcoin using scrypt-adaptive-N as a proof-of-work algorithm.
 - 1 minute block targets
 - subsidy halves in 2 million blocks (~4 years)
 - 10,105 million total coins
 - 10,000 million premined coins
 - 105,000,000 coins ready to mine
 - 25 coins per block
 - Every block to retarget difficulty with Kimotos Gravity Well algorithm

The main problem with any cryptocurrency is that it does not spread widely amongst Internet users 
because new crypto coins are mined by not many people (usually a few hundreds only) who well 
understand computers technology and have special equipment so that ordinary Internet users 
cannot mine new coins and must to buy it.

The main idea behind Speedcoin is different. It is to evenly distribute pre-mined Speedcoins 
to millions of Facebook users across the world through an open clear process on our website. 
Its  process distribution is similar to Iceland's Auroracoin but ours is distributed globally.  

Any Facebook user simply needs to go to Speedcoin.co and log in to our website and enter 
Speedcoin address. 100 SPD will be sent to him automatically. To ensure the same user does 
not use multiple Facebook accounts we request that the user have verified Facebook and 
10+ people in his Facebook friend list.

To promote the success of Speedcoin worldwide, we use affiliate programme on our website 
Speedcoin.co and pay 5 Speedcoins  as a Reward for each new user. Webmasters can place the 
Speedcoin affiliate link on their website/s and normal users can sent the affiliate link to 
their friends or publish it in their blogs. In our opinion, any time you use to spread the 
news of Speedcoin should be rewarded. That is why we made the affiliate programme.

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Speedcoin
development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion (if they haven't already) on the
[mailing list](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=bitcoin-development).

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see `doc/coding.txt`) or are
controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Speedcoin.


Windows Installation
------------------
run speedcoin-1.0-win32-setup.exe 


Linux Installation
------------------
    cd ~ 
    git clone https://github.com/spdcoin/speedcoin 
    cd ~/speedcoin/src/leveldb 
    sh build_detect_platform build_config.mk ./ 
    cd .. 
    make -f makefile.unix USE_UPNP=- 
    cp speedcoind .. 
    ~/speedcoin/speedcoind # start server


Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and
remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code.

Unit tests for the core code are in `src/test/`. To compile and run them:

    cd src; make -f makefile.unix test

Unit tests for the GUI code are in `src/qt/test/`. To compile and run them:

    qmake BITCOIN_QT_TEST=1 -o Makefile.test bitcoin-qt.pro
    make -f Makefile.test
    ./speedcoin-qt_test
