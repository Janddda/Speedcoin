 ##   Copy speedcoin.conf file in Speedcoin Data Directory  
 ## 
 ##   Windows
 ##   --------------	
 ##   Go to Start -> Run (or press WinKey+R) and run this:
 ##   explorer %APPDATA%\Speedcoin
 ##   Speedcoin data directory will open. 
 ##   copy this speedcoin.conf in that folder
 ##
 ##   Linux
 ##   --------------	
 ##   By default Speedcoin data directory:
 ##   ~/.speedcoin/
 ##   If that's not it, you can do a search like this:
 ##   find / -name wallet.dat -print 2>/dev/null
 ##
 ##   Mac
 ##   --------------	
 ##   By default Speedcoin data directory:
 ##   ~/Library/Application Support/Speedcoin/
 ##                                                          ##

 ##            Quick Primer on addnode vs connect            ##
 ##  Let's say for instance you use addnode=4.2.2.4          ##
 ##  addnode will connect you to and tell you about the      ##
 ##    nodes connected to 4.2.2.4.  In addition it will tell ##
 ##    the other nodes connected to it that you exist so     ##
 ##    they can connect to you.                              ##
 ##  connect will not do the above when you 'connect' to it. ##
 ##    It will *only* connect you to 4.2.2.4 and no one else.##
 ##                                                          ##
 ##  So if you're behind a firewall, or have other problems  ##
 ##  finding nodes, add some using 'addnode'.                ##
 ##                                                          ##
 ##  If you want to stay private, use 'connect' to only      ##
 ##  connect to "trusted" nodes.                             ##
 ##                                                          ##
 ##  If you run multiple nodes on a LAN, there's no need for ##
 ##  all of them to open lots of connections.  Instead       ##
 ##  'connect' them all to one node that is port forwarded   ##
 ##  and has lots of connections.                            ##
 ##       Thanks goes to [Noodle] on Freenode.               ##
